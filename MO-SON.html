            Locomotive, Sound-Based Museum of Queer Art
            </p>
            <p id="project_description">Tasked with designing a 3000ft art gallery and an additional 2000ft of site, cafe, public event, and office spaces on the busy corner intersection of Santa Monica and Sunset Boulevard, the MO-SON – Museum of Sound of Nails – is a locomotive, sound-based experience of queer art . While you explore this Silverlake site, you'll soon see that not only does its form revolve around sound and water, but so does its audio articulation: the sound of the noisy LA landscape, the serene sound of flowing water, and each artist controlling the audio that plays in your headphones when you're in their artistic space create an immersive audio performances that enhances your visual experience of each unique space.</p>
