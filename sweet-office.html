            <p id="project_description">A collection of playful desert pieces whose origins are that of typical office chairs. <br>
                                        The geometry of the final product underwent a series of steps to arrive at its final products. A singular chair was initially taken and its individual components–separated into the wheels, legs, seat, back, and main support frame–used to carve out negative spaces from cubic volumes, similar to that of product foam packaging (Image 1). From there, the uniquely carved pieces were re-arranged back into a new formation of a chair that represents the positive volumetric aesthetic of the original piece but with the new negative spaces (Image 2). Finally, the prior were arranged into a new landscape that aimed to blend the negative geometry of the individual chair pieces into a more abstract, unified entity (Images 4, 5) and with the more alluring materiality of a desert dish, only to be re-packaged once more into a compacted volume like the foam safety of foam packaging would be.
