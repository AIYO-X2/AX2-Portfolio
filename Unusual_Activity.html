                Lamp Design + Art Film</p>
            <p id="project_description">Fabricated from a multitude of sequin-filled gift ribbons formed into two shapes – (1) a cylinder whose back face is sealed into a line and whose front face is an open hole with a line cutting through it, and (2) a triangular cone – "Unusual Activity" is an artistic light apparatus that mimics the dichotomy of a mysterious life form that lures people in with its charming spins and beautiful cylinders, only to then attack with its pointed cones that protrude outward in a semi-spherical array from its "heart" – the central, underside glow of the lightbulb. within. The artistic film of this lamp tells this story too, with the chaotic, violent, and mesmerizing classical masterpiece of Benjamin Britten's "Four Seas Interlude" audio for enhancement.</p>
