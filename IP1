The Everlasting Medium
Identity Theft of a Video Game Character
<br><br>
March 4th, 2024, ~3:38 PM. That is the time for which I can most precisely recall first feeling a certain uneasiness in the way video games can act as a medium for recording time. In that moment, I was visiting an ecology-oriented film and game exhibition, "Alluvials" by Alice Bucknell at Los Angeles' Killscreen (now known as Gameplayarts) with an architecture student fellow of mine that day; the content explored alternative, capacitive realities of Los Angeles in the context of its river vitality, and, more precisely, the tensions between the manufactured manner of water importation and the natural reclamation of the local dessert environment with respect to a multitude of biologies inhabiting it. The film, segmented into seven distinct parts, spanned roughly 35 minutes long. One might expect the proceeds of this writing to largely delve into that half-hour-long visual-audio experience, but not this time. Rather, after watching 35 minutes of alternate and possible future realities of Los Angeles play out - notably a an almost swamp-like, water righ LA, a sand-filled dessert-reclaimed LA, and and a fire-stoken LA - it was a short, animated segment that played for only a few seconds between the end of the film and start of the credits that instilled a sort of hollow thought in mine: four pixelated, gif-like-animated glyphs of the biologies featured in the film's LA realities, two of which were a moth and a wolf-like or panther-like animal in respective looping animations of flapping wings and howling. They were all undergoing an ever-increasing magnitude of digital artifacting and, for the few seconds these beings were animated, their essence began to dissolve as the artifacts of the pixels begun to overwhelm their visual presence. In that moment, I could feel the gentle turbulence of the moth's flapping wings hitting my larger human body and the other's howl piercing the silence of the audience. In those moments, I started to feel as though the gentle turbulence of the moth's wings were fracturing as it digitally decayed and the other's howl transfering into tinnitus as it audibly ceased but continued in my imaginitive ears. At the end of those moments, I could feel the effects of beings, who'd I grown some attachment to by the precluding 35-minute-long film, almost being erased as their essence was transmitted to live on in the of digital space; the process of being consumption by the pixelated, digital artifacts seemed to call as though they would become exclusivities of digital life as their real life precense ceased.

I am not unaware that my sort of writing style can sometimes appear as trying to be too formal and artistic (I certainly do enjoy crafting words into emotionally-evoking, thought-provoking sentiments), but I also find no fear in interjecting this informal sidequest before proceeding. No writing which excels at this sort of provokation is delivered in such a lectured format; there should be moments of incohesion that deliver the words as though it is a conversation between more than a singular mind. "This all sounds very subjective, does it not? You make much word of feeling a certain way like this or that about these pixels, but are those the intentions of the artist? How are you to prove the objectivity of this sort of thing? Not everyone is going to recieve the visual of those artifacting pixels in the same light." Well, truthfully, I am not here to prove anything as being definitive. In fact, I am no more educated or special to write on this topic than anyone else who has delved into the arts of game engine space. I am merely here as a messenger for this discourse to hopefully engage you in the thought-provoking mindset for those intrigued by this sort of field. Even more so is the fact that there is a not small likelihood that I am misremembering the particular way in which Alice animated these glyphs since they were so brief and my mind was scurrying with 35 minutes of other thoughts to deliberate. Nonetheless, if they truly existed in such a particular state as I describe them matters not, but rather the existence of such a visual and what it means for the virtualization of essence is the premise I am engrossed by. Back to that...

These glyphs mentally adhered to me as my fellow and I endeavoured the remainder of the exhibition, our time just spent standing outside of the gallery discussing other academias spawned by it, and even throughout my hour drive home following. I could not reliniquish those few seconds of harrowing animation from my visual memory bank. I vaguely understood my reasoning as it being their dissolution from existence into digital space as a loss of living, but I did not fully question the implications that could potentially explain my uneasiness until much later in the day when, of all things, I scrolled onto a TikTok post: it was two slideshow images which loosely stated, "DBD News! Rest in Peace, Zoey Alexandria. Thank you for everything you've given our community. Her obituary is below." DBD is an acronym for Dead by Daylight, an asymmetrical horror game...and one of my guilty pleasure video games. I was unfamiliar with Zoey, but a fragment of curiosuity led me to a quick search which showed that she was a trans voice actor who voiced the game's most recently released killer, "The Unknown". The killer's design plays on "creepypasta" internet stories that instilled many boogeyman-like fears in the kids of the early 2000s - content like The Rake, Jeff the Killer, and, most infamously, Slender Man. The Unknown's creative narrative is a being which comes to kill any who think of it; the creature's true appearance and origins are (pun naturally intended) unknown, and, instead, those are dynamically fabricated unto itself with the stories people come up of it; the killer, essentially, embodies the visual, audio, and narrative elements of whatever stories are prescribed to it and whatever lives it claims.

"Aw, how sad." My initial reaction was nothing but unordinary sadness; I didn't know of Zoey's name until then, but I did know of Zoey as "The Unknown" through its voicelines from the numerous times it had chased me around in-game, as did much of the DBD community regarded in the aforementioned line "Thank you for everything you've given our community". 

Identity theft in video games. Controlling the characters as though they were still alive

Almost undoubtedly there is content out there which could better unanimously exemplify the discourse of this writing - the Alluvials, Dead by Daylight, and The Talos Principle are about as synonomous as a peach-filled cake, a set of acrylic nails, a book store. Objectively speaking, one is a casual adventure game about water ecology, another a multiplayer horror game that is essentially a bunch of drunk adults playing bloody tag, and the third a philosophical horror game. Here though, at least for the sort of thought provokation I want to illicit from you, we will proudly eat our cake, clawing thunks of it with our 4" press-on acrylic in the middle of a Barnes&Nobles.
