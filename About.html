                <p id="project_description">My name is Ariel, a.k.a. Aiyo, and, yes, that's me with an ice cream cone dumped on my head. <br> <br>
                    I'm a current design student with a huge passion for artistic architecture, both physical and virtual, and the sort of pocket worlds they can create, wherein each design is its own ride of deep, evokative emotions that may be bright and poppy, or dark and abysmal, or something in-between; anything goes. In particular, I find that I'm drawn to designing on the edge of questionability, as the uniqueness of such always piques desire to explore that then leads to an almost fantasy-like experience.<br> <br>
                    I plan to invest a large portion of my design skills in "virtual architecture" to help build the forseeable "metaverse", what I envision as a place where mine and others' ideas, both architectural and not, can exist freely in virtual reality to deliver otherworldly sensations with the experiences existing in their purest forms, not chained back by the limitations of the real world. I'm also always thinking about how I can blend both my virtual architecture and physical architecture to create a symbiotic relationship where they interact with and enhance one another.<br><br>
