            <p id="project_description">Respecting users' privacy is a top concern in regards to my VR experiences.<br>
                <br>
                None of my publicly available experiences collect or profile any sort of data about you.<br>
                <br>
                It is, however,  notable that Oculus/Meta records, and shares with us app developers and publishers, basic analytics about your usage of our VR experiences published through their Quest Store, including number of installs, revenue, monthly active users, average in-app frame rate, average monthly time spent in-app, average user rating, and the current country of active users.  Do know that these analytics are completely anonymous and do not allow us to identify any particular users.</p>
