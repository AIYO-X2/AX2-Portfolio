            <p id="project_description">Situated inside and underneath the LA River, the "Forsaken Realm" is a museum inspired by the negative emotion of forsaken. The particular experience being evoked from this singular word is one of being abandoned in a desolate, unfamiliar environment that is both hostile and mystifying; perceived danger lurks at every corner, yet interest entices you to venture. The design is indicative of a parasite that feeds on the river, the three mouths of which, each known as "rifts", are designed based on three major points of why the LA River has failedâ€“how it itself has become an abandoned mess of concrete channels. Users explore the Forsaken Realm with a purely monochromatic light so as to break the optics of reality; sharp, grotesque, cavity-filled teeth fill the interior vantablack void walls and "attack" people; deep, soul-shaking vibrations eminate back and forth throughout the realm like breathing life; and art installations lay scattered throughout like they've been swallowed up. This project was in callobration with peer <a class="project_description_link_text" href="https://www.lucyt.com">Lucy Taylor</a>, who designed the counterpart gallery, "urbanAWE", that is situated above ground and features a similar biotic design language, but based on the positive emotion that is awe. Together, the balance of the "Forsaken Realm" and "urbanAWE" create the collective "Museum of Emotions".</p>
