                Canine Shelter For The Remarkable Border Collie
            </p>
            <p id="project_description">Situated in the cold, hilly elevations of Los Angeles and in the backyard of a family residence, "The Lurking Mine" is a canine shelter designed for the remarkably intelligent Border Collie. The triangulated exterior creates multitudes of peaks that are indicative of the dog's watchful eyes from the breed originally being an animal herder, which is then reinforced by the striking fully-oxidized copper materiality. This sharp, teal exterior then contrasts the warm, vibrant interior, just like the dog's dueling personality, both of which also utilize the way in which dog vision is primarily receptive of blue and yellow colors. The brains of the Border Collie are put to use with a button that allows it to open and close the shelter's doors at will, as well as a musical panel that can teach the dog to play simple 5-note piano melodies in return for treats.</p>
