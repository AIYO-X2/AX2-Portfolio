                With love, this site was coded completley from scratch in Visual Studio Code and is always in continous evolution. Thanks to all of the medium-zoom Github contributors (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom">https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom</a>) which provided the zoom functionality code for all graphics on this site; thanks to Jhett Lien (<a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/marduklien/pen/MdvdEG">https://codepen.io/marduklien/pen/MdvdEG</a>) who provided the video scroll code for the homepage of this site.<br>

                This site is hosted through GitHub, which is a zero-net, open-source platform for sharing and collaborating on code. The website, as of 19 March 2023, has a net weight of 885mb and is constantly being optimized and reduced for a snappier experience and more sustainable operations. This site also uses LocalStorage instead of Cookies for any involved code functions, which is a plus for your privacy and more sustainable as it is single-query. Code edits and pushes to the site are also never done between 4pm-9pm PST (California peak energy usage hours) so that all energy used to update/service the site are at a much higher probability of being sourced from renewable energy instead of fossil or coal.
