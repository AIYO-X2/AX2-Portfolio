                Metaphorical Analysis and Abstract Creation from band Chicago's hit song "25 or 6 to 4"</p>
            <p id="project_description">From the very early 70's came one of renowned band Chicago's most famous songs: "25 or 6 to 4". While the technicalities of the message behind it are often left up to subjectivity, with some believing that there is an influence of drugs or others to its creation, the song, at its core, revolves around the sleepless nights that ensue from the drive for birthing creativity; in this case, the all-nighter that Robert Lamm talks of is for the creation of a song, though all artists/creators know the feeling.
                All of the above diagrams establish my personal interpretation and analysis of the balance and message of lyrics, the instruments for the way in which they rise and fall, create pattern, establish occlusion and transparency in relation to one another...The physical model depicted with lots of medal, glass, wood, and black spheres is a very direct translation of the experience of the instruments throughout the entire song. On the other hand, the secondary AR model that is of an over-saturated purple translates to the experience of the message throughout the song: that is, the  dizziness and heavy static of burnout you feel throughout the push of a creative all-nighter that exponentionally builds as you deny your body of sleep, leading to an overstimulation of the senses that then causes them to become overwhelmingly sensitive to all stimuli, such as reaching sunrise and being blinded to migraines by the light and becoming hypertuned to the smallest of sounds.</p>
