                960 simulators are given a 30-second lifespan to interface the city and its other simulators; each simulator is added to the simulation one by one through a single device; the simulators can only communicate through physical gestures; the physical actions of each spawned simulator are recorded in time and space and are replayed in an indefinite 30-second loop. Here, the city is no longer augmented by the afflictions of digital space; it is, instead, a pure construction of the abstraction of the digital space that manifests as limits in respect to our pre-digital world. The experience forces the current simulator to relinquish authorship of the other simulators as they are already recorded in motion while giving authorship back to the simulator as they try–and almost definitely misunderstand–the narrative or interpretation of their limited communication abilities. The error of digital resolution here yields curious results and compromises, though what deeper afflictions arise if the medium is forced upon us in such a manner in stasis? What happens if we allow our cities, our social abilities, and our enjoyment of sensations to be degraded into such a belittling virtual complexity?
                <br><br>
                What does it say about our being if we need simulations to empathize with our own biology?
                <br><br>
                As you watch the captured video of the simulation, take note of the way stories unfold: as each lifespan is added sequentially to the simulation in accordance with the playback of the video, new stories begin to compose themselves as additional current lifespans become captured in space and time adjacent to already captured and looping lifespans.

                The modern-day urban city is a simulation so profound [that] its operations have dissolved beyond the recession of background. The collective “we” of urban fabric are not only witnessing but also simultaneously experiencing an ever-increasing transience in the function of our lives as the threshold between human and machine further blurs. For the last decade or so we have existed, at certain proximities, as bio-mechanical beings with our pocket devices that grant us instantaneous access to worlds monumentally larger than our own — worlds so monumental that they often begin to overwrite our own. We no longer know how to get between two points of the city without GPS instruction; digital communication has inhibited our in-person communication and spatial awareness — we interface thousands of other lives each and every day with zero thought to their existence beyond their passing moment; the bio-mechanical fiction has even become so romanticized that it has imbued itself into our permanence with decisions such as buildings that are constructed of adverts themselves, rather than being augmented by them at the facade. In that sense the city, both physically and ideologically and both from it and to it, is being reformatted to better enable an emerging bio-mechanical era. Is there a means to return to a time in which we are no longer afflicted by these products of our manufactured nature? (These products which go against our biological nature) How can we go back or go forward to an era which disconnects us from this particular simulation? Perhaps we must fall deeper into it to gain a sense of what we are losing.

                Alice Bucknell, who explores simulations of her own through game engines, writes on the topic of virtual reality (VR) as an empathy machine through Kudsk Steensen who created a VR experience based around a recently extinct bird; the experience allows simulators to interact with the bird in a reconstruction of its native environment, hearing the sounds of the forest and its harrowing call. It operates as a way to develop a meaningful emotional experience that has the potential to alter our viewpoints and be more critical upon our own being: it forces us to empathize with a sense of sorrow in hearing its call, knowing our role in its extinction – a quite stark contrast to other simulation work, like that of Ian Cheng’s, which revolves around the human in direct reference. Cheng’s “Emissaries” is a collection of works which record the evolving stories of humans in fictitious, though still Earthly, environments. It positions the human interfacing the simulation as a mere spectator to it, as all of the motives of the humans in the simulation are driven by the decisions of individual artificial intelligence characters instilled with varied personalities. This sort of approach forces humans to reconcile with realities which have no capacity for human input, a quite unconventional approach in the world of game engines and overall digital space. -->
