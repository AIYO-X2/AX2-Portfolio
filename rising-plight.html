            <div id="project_description">Designed for film "Oxygen Nexus", Rising Plight is a body augmentation that portrays the increasing loss of individuality and possession over our own souls through the advent of new, immersive technologies developed by abusive power; "Rising Plight" is literally an unfortunate and dangerous situation whose increasing magnitude was both accidental and premeditated in respective ways. The short, directed by Saumil Upadhyay, follows a year 2300 human enslaved to a simulated reality of trail running where the exertions of his and his fellow humans' unconscious, real-life bodies are used to energize an architectural embodiment of magnificent stature. The body augmentation was commissioned for the film to depict the mechanical operations and restrictions imposed on the human body in such a dystopian future: the headpiece hinges around the jaw, locked in place by a hydrualic, piston-like arm; various tubes which weave in and out between mind, face, and body to supply a multitude of services like sensory stimulations of the nose and mouth, and provide necessary vitals to sustain the life inside the machine; and computational machinery protrudes off the face plate as the backbone of all these performative elements. The inter-related organization of these individual elements on the headpiece is one that is of poor design; it was clearly not designed to be so powerful from the beginning and instead was spontaneously iterated upon as the ability to keep the human units immersed in it became more challenging. While the dilapidated and continually decaying state of the body augmentation further imbue the severity of such a reality, they are also the faults which widen the door for escape...</div>
