                <p id="project_description">I'm Ariel–a.k.a. Aiyo–and, yes, that's me with an ice cream cone dumped on my head. <br> <br>
                    I'm a current design student with a huge passion for artistic architecture, both physical and virtual, and the sort of pocket worlds they can create. My interests, in particular, resonate with curating experiences of emotions – evokative emotions that may be bright and poppy, or dark and abysmal, or something in-between; anything goes.<br> <br>
                    I plan to invest a large portion of my design skills in "virtual architecture" to help build the forseeable "metaverse", what I envision as a place where mine and others' ideas, both architectural and not, can exist freely in virtual reality to deliver otherworldly sensations with the experiences existing in their purest forms, not chained back by any limitations, save for our imaginations, and how I can thereafter blend both my virtual architecture and physical architecture to create a symbiotic relationship where they interact with and enhance one another.<br><br>
                    "I equate architecture to reality itself. I say that reality is the experiences of the world that our body translates to impact our soul, and it is impossible to exist with open senses without coming into contact with the material truth of this wake, so architecture is, therefore, reality."
